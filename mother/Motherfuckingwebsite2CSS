        <h1>This is <em>still a motherfucking website.</em></h1>
        <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
       
        <header>
            <h2>Seriously,it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h1>
<p> <strong>7 fucking declarations</strong></p>
<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a>
into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking <em>simple</em> and it still has all the glory of the 
original perfect-ass website:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shit's <em>still</em></li> lightweight and loads fast
    <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
    <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
    <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accesible to every asshole that vistis your site</li>
    <li>Shit's <em>still</em>legible and gets your fucking point across</li>

</ul>
<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
<p>you neverknew it, but it's easy to improve readibily on your site. Here's how.</p>
<h2>Let it breath</h2>
<p>
    Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married thy probablyshould'nt be humping.
    The defauls are trash-- 
    pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter.
    If you can't see that...Piss off.
</p>
<p>
    If your text hits the side of the browser,fuck off forever.You ever see a book like that?
    Yes? What a shitty book.
</p>
<h2>A little less contrast</h2>
<p>Black on white? How often doo you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. Iwould've made 
    this site's background a nice <div id="EEE"> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</div>
</p>
<H2>
    Size matters

</H2>
<p>
    I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close
    to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print,not the screen.

</p>
<h2>Line-with,motherfucker</h2>
<p>
    looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long; Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might
    actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.
    <H2>
        Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck.
    </H2>
    <p>
        I love what the creator of this site's inspiration did.
    </p>
